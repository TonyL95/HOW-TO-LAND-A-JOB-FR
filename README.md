# HOW-TO-LAND-A-JOB-FR

Aight listen up
There’s no point in even looking at this doc if you aren’t SPAM APPLYING. It’s not hard and the more you do it the higher the chance you even land an interview which is the hardest part. Make it a priority to apply to AT LEAST 5 jobs a day SKRAAAAAAAAAA.






Leetcode -
Python is the best language you can leetcode with (syntax is ez and libraries are OP). Learn Python if you don’t already know it. You don’t wanna be that dude asking how to declare an array in Java mid interview because you forgot the syntax.

Techniques you’ll need to know (* means study later):
Data structures (How they work and when to use)
Arrays
Stacks
Trees
Linked List
Hashmap/Hashset
Queues
Tries*
Heap/Priority Queue*
Graphs**
Algorithms/Techniques
Sliding window
Binary Search
Two pointer
Greedy
Breadth first search/Depth first search
Dynamic Programming*** (Hard af, unlikely to come up in interview but possible)
Others
Recursion
String traversal and manipulation
2D data structures







Leetcode Questions
G - Easy
M - Medium
H - Hard
Don't look at the solution right away—it leads to memorization, not learning. If stuck, watch Neetcode on YouTube. First, watch the explanation and attempt coding yourself. If still stuck, then watch the coding portion.

It really helps to draw out a solution step by step. Take a test case and run through the code by hand on paper to see exactly how the code works. In my opinion this is the most optimal way to learn a data structure or algorithm. For example if the problem involves a stack, draw the stack, track variable changes, note every pop operation, etc.

Do easy questions first and work your way up to mediums. Don’t be sad if u can’t do mediums at first they kinda hard no caps.

First questions to try
Fizzbuzz (LOL)
Two Sum
Greatest number of candies
Arrays (Self explanatory)
Contains Duplicate
Valid Anagram
Group Anagrams
Top K Frequent Elements (came up in my friends interview)
Product of Array Except Self
Stacks
Valid Parenthesis (If you aren’t familiar with stacks, draw this one out on paper)
Min Stack (Teaches you how a stack works by making you design one using an array)
Trees
This is the one I struggled with the most. You should start off with learning how to traverse a tree. You can apply these traversals to basically any other tree question.
Pre Order Traversal
In Order Traversal
Post Order Traversal
It helps to visualize the traversals by tracing it on paper. After you’re comfortable traversing a binary tree, try to use the traversals to perform a search for an element.
Search a Binary Search Tree
After you fully understand how the search and traversals work for trees, try a few basic tree questions.
Same Tree
Invert Binary Tree
Max Depth of Binary Tree
